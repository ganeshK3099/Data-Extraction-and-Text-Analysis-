# Data-Extraction-and-Text-Analysis-
The objective of this project is to extract textual data articles from the given URL and perform text analysis to compute variables that are explained below. 

# Data Extraction(Input.xlsx)
For each of the articles, given in the input.xlsx file, extract the article text and save the extracted article in a text file with URL_ID as its file name.
While extracting text, please make sure your program extracts only the article title and the article text. It should not extract the website header, footer, or anything other than the article text. 
NOTE: I HAVE USED BEATUIFULSOUP PYTHON LIBRARIES FOR DATA CRAWLING.

# Data Analysis
For each of the extracted texts from the article, perform textual analysis and compute variables, given in the output structure excel file. You need to save the output in the exact order as given in the output structure file, “Output Data Structure.xlsx”
